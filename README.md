## Learning Steps

### Step 1: Setting up the Project

1. Created a new directory for the project on my computer.
2. Initialized a new Git repository:
```git init```
3. Created a `README.md` file to document the project.
4. Created and activated a new virtual environment:

- Creating: ```python -m venv venv```
- Activating(on windows): ```.venv/Scripts/activate```
5. Created a `requirements.txt` file and added Flask as a dependency.
6. Installed the project dependencies: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
